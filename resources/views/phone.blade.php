               PickUp is a cabpooling platform where you book an air-conditioned ride to any destination at an affordable rate. If we find a passenger along the way, we hook them with the same ride. And if we don’t, you still ride at the same rate! With just 2 travellers with you and the driver, we have ensured that you get the privacy and spatial comfort you need while travelling.
